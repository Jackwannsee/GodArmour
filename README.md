First minecraft plugins to run this upload into eclipse export(make sure java 1.8) when upload to the plugins folder run the /rl or /reload command.
to check if it worked you can either do /plugins to see if there is a new plugin there called the name you gave it during the extract proccess.
if the plugin isnt their something has gone wrong best thing to do is check the console if that doesnt work close laptop and give up.

make sure your server is running spiggot (mine is currently running 1.16.3) but i belive either version 12 or 13 up will work with this plugin.
